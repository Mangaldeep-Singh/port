    Yes, I created this site to improve my writing skills. It's where I share ideas and experiences about things I've
    researched or worked on. Because it's my first time writing, it's inevitable that I'll make some unexpected
    mistakes. Hope readers can ignore and give me suggestions to improve day by day.
